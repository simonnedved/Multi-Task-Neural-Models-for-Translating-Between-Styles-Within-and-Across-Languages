I mean you have to be her friend.
are you asking a rhetorical question?
men pretend to love to have sex, women pretend to enjoy sex in order to get love.
I don't intend to be mean.
I would say an average of 45% first, but once you get acquainted with the person, maybe 15%.
because some women send subtle messages to men rather than being clear.
let us buy coffee and talk to that point!
and I hate it when my dad is unhappy.
ask him if you should go see a doctor.
you can post more questioins on Yahoo!
he probably has lots of things to worry about right now other than you.
but i don't think he will cheat or leave you due to lack of sex.
will I always feel that way?
but he may like all the waiting, dreaming and flirting.
and I would like to try again.
some men shave, it depends on the woman.
well if you really like this guy then smile and talk nicely to him.
I don't know if he loves you, but he definitely likes you.
I would invite you on a date but i live in Oregon and i'm totally uniformed as to where you live.
women are coomplicated.
I realize I'm overly selective when it comes to people, how can I stop this?
doing that does sound like a girly.
sometimes, if the good outweighs the bad, then the difficulties are worth it.
if both of you agree to do this.
one female, Michelle, who probably wouldn't be mentioned, said she didn't believe in it.
well why do you like the one boy who picks on you?
and men sometimes think they don't need you that bad until you are gone.
alas, if a guy asks you, don't be afraid to say negatively.
do I want to be in love?
that's the name I applied to it, for what reason, though?
they will think you are leering if you look at them creepily.
I think you are right, it's confusing.
how do i get my boyfriend to show me that he loves me.
that is if you really love them.
don't sell yourself, even if he's rich.
you sound live a very lovely person so don't let these women make you feel bad.
I don't know, but I have knowledge of another webpage that I visit.
I really urge you to consider how many overly confident women exist.
without being in a relationship, that might appear to be a little promiscuous.
he asked if I want to use his chapstick.
you can say it but only if you mean it also hold her hands and look into her eyes.
you should never let a guy mistreat you.
absolutely not, he's too fat, and I'm not sure.
you can tell him if he says yes.
what was the mistake that you took part in?
King has a song about this its called Only Your Mother Loves you.'
why are we in a relationship if our partner treats us badly after we fall in love?
if you have experienced it, what was it like?
it's not a turn off if she drinks too much.
if that's want you want.
it's like getting rid of a drug habit.
wow, I should do that the next time I'm dating.
what is your desire, though?
sounds like you both are comfortable with how things are now.
don't let her dominate your life for she will just have to learn to deal with it.
if he doesn't go out with you, don't worry, there are plenty of other options.
no man gave you everything you want.
if you want to stay married you need to find yourself.
start with a simple common question and proceed from that point.
ask what they want to go to a place with you.
trust him and don't bring the matter up again.
I'm still trying to work up my nerves to try that out.
find the one who loves you too.
I'll be your significant other is you come to me town.
stay far away from this guy.
it's your choice not to hate one, I hate them all, to say the least.
I would say about 3 or 4.
I don't know, would you enjoy having an serted forcefully in your rectum?
he's a womanizer and has been telling that to some young woman.
I knew all my ex girlfriends were not the one until I met my wife.
don't try to have both of them at once, whatever you do.
sex is not the only thing important in life!
I have a yahoo e-mail address and that is sufficient for me.
for me, fun has eating meals.
but he was a little busy afterwards.
that will just be sex.
don't approach her and let her know that you find her looks hot.
sounds like you are going through plenty of things right now.
but you should ask a girl about the symptoms, since I am a boy.
I had always felt the same way but my views changed when I met my true love!
guys are stupid, what person understands the meaning behind their behavior???????????????????
your best friend is a good choice to marry in nobody else works out.
I don't want to approach suddenly and ask, Will you go out with me?
unless you know him pretty well, you are stinking yourself out there to get hurt.
you need to replace it just add it back in the same way you did the first time.
if it's your personal belief in something it's not good or bad.
they annoy you all throughout the day.
either go to Hawaii or pay someone.
his or her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, good looks, and how active they are.
I can just stop caring about him and forget about him as though he meant nothing to me.
is it like a clear liquid that turns yellow when it dries?
it's a turn off if she sits on your best friend's lap when drunk.
well if it was before his relationship with you then obviously he wasn't cheating at all.
he had a controlling personality.
Determination is one of the gifts we can give ourselves.
get married only after you have been with a guy for at least 2 years.
hi and hugs to all my fellow girls at cone!
when you are wither her, just be yourself.
I have no idea what you are trying to say.
a guy asked if i would mind cuddling with him.
why would some guys do that?
a few good women are left, you just have to look in the right places.
move on or work it out with your partner.
get a hold of yourself, how could you love a person that you don't even talk to?
find a talented girl who is pretty.
that doesn't mean you are dirty ious.
it's the only time in your life, you can live out true love!
you will have to find an answer yourself.
give them two months and they will get over you.
after some time, you won't see the color.
he probably wants to know if you like him.
if she is not interested in you.
you are definitely not a promiscuous woman, so don't worry.
no way exists for forcing a person to feel romantically towards you.
break up and keep yourself open to other options.
have you had a pap smear?
I can just say yes and mention that I'm proud and have long black hair.
I have a friend in a similar situation.
I don't know, maybe you are young.
hi my name is going to be anonymous, but i have been working together with this person for years.
I don't understand the question, would someone please give me the answer?
if you really love him then you will tell him.
if you really like her, go with your emotions.
think about whether you can really afford it and if you want to go forward.
get your old life back so you can stay alive.
dude, what you are saying is she does.
don't go to flirting, such behavior isn't appealing.
maybe some women would say that it hurts a lot.
tell him your real desires, that's the info, but an action not tried.
if I were mad, it would be easier to do.
you should move on if they have.
you are being punished, so you don't get to watch TV for a month.
tell him and it wouldn't seem psychotic because you have to know one another for awhile.
but that's her way, you could try it that way or you could stay watchful.
it seems so complicated, could you please explain it again in simple terms?
give them a chance to discover all of your talents.
unless it is with the wrong guy.
my boyfriend loves me very much and doesn't want to lose me.
if they are brunette or not is what matters.
after a while it has to be played out.
everyone, even if they don't admit it, likes to be told they are sexy.
I like to go dancing at clubs in downtown Huston.
good luck, but remember to do your homework.
I like natural appearances, rather than a full face of makeup.
if you like the guy then try it.
we are now just divorced.
someone said women don't have feelings?
actions are better than words.
I've been thinking of a mid-level pink hue, but what should it be with?
watch for if he telephones, sends an electronic mail or even cares.
don't ignore her, listen to her, and don't change the subject.
he is my only source of income until i graduate from college.
she will tell you if it's not ok.
I don't think I mind either way.
don't eat in the same place you defecate.
trying to get some blonde highlights too.
don't worry about him, concentrate on your classes, and your boyfriend.

this is Doctor Izzy speaking, I love and love plus-size women!
it's ok to jump on him if he is flirting with her.
stick with the boys who are either 13 or 14.

that's good, it's like getting your dad's blessing.
unless you are desperate wait for him to ask you out.
I really like this guy, I'm not sure if it is love or just a infatuation.
if he insists then it means sex is his only goal.
I've found out if I have a concerts, I can visualize a reality that I know is not typically present.
I would like to have some fun with you thats why i answered this stupid question.
do you feel that way?
give your brother some money and tell him he should leave.
maybe he will call you.
something you can o is imagine your life with out him or her.
if you really want to keep company with her that much then you have to make it your top priority.
I pick the domestic goddess.
do you love her deeply?
guys get bored before women do.
you can save money with respect to flowers.
I want to go to the United States of America, what things would I need.
if you are not happy then you need to fix it or leave.
just because he has potential to be a decent boyfriend doesn't mean that he will be.
she may think that looks ugly in my opinion, blue looks better.

having a big penis doesn't mean you are good in bed.
yes it looks pretty beautiful on almost any woman.
men have issues with secrets.
yes it depends on the guy.
people had questioned me why was I rushing?
both of them don't respect your feelings.
even though I see him each week in PSR I can't find the courage to talk to him.
I don't find a guy that acts that way.
I like men who shave their legs.
is gay or is it just curiosity?
in my opinion, they do.
it's a wrong decision that can't be undone!
I lost my virginity in a park when I was 16.
they have never met in person but she says they are in love.

repel your fear and tell him.
I wouldn't drive for 5 hours just to spend time with someone unless I really liked her alot.

I can't picture my life without my husband.
we seem to always push away the ones who we love.
if you both feel the same way when you are older then go for it.
tell her, women enjoy hearing the truth, best of luck to you.
you have to decide whether you want to spend the rest of your life with whom you constantly argue.
I use the term 'guy' very lightly when talking about you.
personally, I prefer a and B cups.
any woman looks hot when standing beside an ugly man.
I would date someone 10 years younger, who wants to date an older woman?

ok i have been attracted to this girl since i was in the ninth grade.
did you see her looking at you?
I never knew that life could be so great.
all right, I'm really into this one guy and I don't know, go his feelings in return.
what is best for both of you?
at least she didn't give you a fake number.
so in my opinion, you are not a slut.
but let them get married if they can't control themselves.

why bother if you are already doing it?
many times you have loved a guy, but not sure if he loved you back.
should I break up with him because of his mom?
make a nice move and if there is no responce, she's not interested.
I have friends that get married after 6 months of dating.
be genuine, ask after their life and you might get a response.
show her your skills to her.
you will just look silly.
that's a culture that has things right.
if you don't ask the question, you'll always wonder about the answer.
tell me your opinion thank you.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
what is the worst thing that could happen?
I'm confused and don't know what to do because I hate for the girl to be that way.
find someone who doesn't hate you.
don't be rude, don't be rude.
not true, most girls are just discreet.
sure guys just have no inclination toward dancing.
this is not an intelligent generation.

depends on if you were able to trust him.
ugly and fat guys just accept what they can get.
people choose to be husbands and wives for reasons.
it's not worth it, if all you do is argue.

girls have curiousity about sex with other girls, myself included!
20-2 is fine and she doesn't have to be younger than you.
the concept is simple, treat them honestly and with love.
when that happens, your decision will be easier to make.
phrases to initiate a romance are tawdry, be genuine and compliment her often.

try to make the best out of a bad situation.
are you looking for a friendship?
I think he would make a great valentine.
this is hard due to the many temptations.
does it generally take a year to feel comfortable or bored in a relationship?
it depends on when you are ready.
of course I would love to meet women.
it's just the way things are.
it's ok to be friends with someone online, but there should be limits.
can you imagine starting a family with him?
should he refuse your request, his value is too low to start with.
to tell the truth, you will learn, but you have to experience things.
hopefully you married your husband because you love him.
well the dependence is in the woman's camp, what is it she likes?
I know i have someone who will be waiting when i come home.
get away from it all, go enjoy a massage.
I don't know where to start.
depends, are you an hot person with an athletic form?
are you talking about your avatar?
try hanging out all day long together and then you can top it off by giving him a foot massage.
if a guy cares about you then he will call.
if your behavior is always as it is now she may come to believe you're in a state of desperation.
in my opinion, there is a big difference between having sex and making Love.'
first of all i have 4 kids so i know being a homemaker is more work than my actual job is.
you don't need to stay together, even if you have a child.
are you a young woman from a ri place or from an urban environment?
getting married and having kids can be postponed, but your studies can't be.
I never went to it.
do you want to be in a relationship with the same guy?
how often can you have sex with Pamela Anderson?
make sure getting your point across doesn't result in her hating you.

I love to run my fingers through curly hair.
I mean the two of you collectively.
the right woman will come along if you are patient.
I want my wife to grow too.
he is obviously shy, maybe you should make a move.
the doctor was surprised too.
should you have fun with the pair of them, she'll probably have rough sex with you.
where do you live, I could come over and you could practice kissing me.
maybe you think it is a no, but it's a yes.
no offence but maybe because your name is freakgirl but if you were to show your face maybe not.
men don't, only little boys.
maybe ask if they want to go out sometime soon.
it happened to me twice.
you shouldn't go out with a guy because you feel the necessity to.
you wouldn't be asking if you really wanted to be with him.
and I just pray that it never passes!
most women are waiting for a guy to tell her his true feelings.
women are more passionate during sex.
just try to impress her.
leaning towards me and kissing me gently on only the forehead.
I'm not that type of person, but I know plenty of people like that.
she cares about herself, no, that shouldn't happen on a primary outing.
ok it depends on how deeply you are starting to experience emotions for this boy!
in advance, thanks for the pep.
why do they want to be married?
we like to be approached softly with some slight chasing.
in any event, I married my husband and wonder if you know the reasons in addition to love.
I would like a trip to an amusement park or a museum.
I have feelings for a person and need to know if i am in love.
do you like fake nails or manicured nails?
first, plan what you want and don't worry about what everyone else wants.
now we do all these things together, I don't know what I should do.
I don't know what you are.
I asked him if he still liked me he said he does but doesn't act that way.
I like the perfume that you wear.
practice being able to unwrap starburst candies with your tongue, women enjoy it.
I think most men don't care, but it depends on the person.
it has nothing to do with being vulnerable, young, or you can't find it.
don't get married so early in the relationship.
you're not a good person of you plan to cheat on your wife.
be the best version of yourself and if he is impressed he will talk to you.
you don't want to be with anyone, but that person.
he's getting married, stop pursuing it.
did you tell her the annoying nature of her daily check-ins with you?
when i move in i was asked out by my neighbor.
most teen-aged boys like teen girls like sex.
he played a good game of basketball.
don't worry, don't worry about it.
are you someone who likes arguing and fighting?
if he likes her and toward you he probably would have terminated the romance to be with you.
the most important issue is not trying to retaliate at the person that wronged you.
one guy willing to move 21 hours and 14 hundred miles just to be with me.
have you seen a doctor yet?
maybe she's not a shrew, but the thin woman definitely was.
pursue an active life and not waste my time.
it's like over-indulging in chocolate and then complaining because you have gained weight.
I traveled there and he was there.
if he's single go for it.
if you don't obey men like this, they usually become the sort who beat their wives.
are you or are you not attracted to him?
if you are sure, then tell your parents you haven't already done so.
alot of people will probably reject you.
do you think he has the same feelings towards you?
some guys only say that word if they mean it.
it seems like he likes you and should show him how you feel.
I think everyone should keep their own name.
friends are forever because guys come and go.
try to imagine that it was love.
I think you should be ready even if your relationship survives the 4 seasons.
all right now certain men like women of that type and others not as much.
if you want kids, then be a homemaker.
younger men and older women, good idea or not?
he wants to go on.
you need to stay faithful to your husband, he is the one you swore vows to.
so there is no alternative to the proper labeling of 'Love.'
and your self-image is very important.
I say those things and I am female.
trust me girls can be just as perverted.
flowers are nice, even if the don't last long.
there are films that I have yet to see.
she is a very sweet girl, just the person you are looking for!
try to use your brain and not your manhood, maybe she doesn't love you.
no disrespect intended, but that does sound like a lady's name.
I wouldn't take the trouble to call him back.
no women I like in my list so I choose my neighbors spouse.
marriage is about trust and comunication.
don't listen to anyone else's advice.
what should i do to be successful with her?
give them a rose and express your love for them.
it's weird, I agree, but it's nothing bad.
you need to see tell what's right for you both.
they are women enough for a guy, but they aren't as sophisticated as us.
exactly, especially when she became sick.
because you know... try to look for your beloved... but be careful!
I can't help any further without more info.
kissing is something you can't do wrong or right.
just take time to decide.
enjoying yourself with guy friends is ok.
just think about those things you like and give the same back, like a massage with one's tongue.
my boyfriend was definately my friend first... that makes it complete euphoria.
I would say, it's more of a trust issue.
I need someone to help me in figuring this out.
then move on if he still doesn't like you.
he probably isn't interested either.
try to make it yourself whenever possible.
can you do anything else besides work and fix things?
I told her I sincerely loved her.
it seems that all of the guy senior students think that freshmen girls are promiscuous, which unfortunate.
so how do I just kiss him?
if you check in the deleted things it should be there.
hope you find a nice girl to date.
I don't think that is a good idea, you're not there for that purpose.
it is a very long list.
I would say Brokeback Mountain, you'll be happy even if it is a guy.
if you don't base your relationship on sex, then it's ok.
I'll probably tell her soon because she is my best friend anyway, any help would be appreciated.
yes, it's a portender of misfortune to glimpse the betrothed at the marriage ceremony.
hold on and stay strong and good luck!
um, modest get together for relatives.
if you're skeptical about the performance piece of it then don't do it.
now I am married now.
I think it depends on age and upbringing.
once you have kids, you need to decide on a last name.
your child will find it hard enough growing up without a father.
bald men look like kids to me, I don't find it attractive.
give it a chance, if you end up breaking up with that person, it will be harder to be friends with them.
ask what the score of the last game was.
if you are dating the guy you love you need to get rid of your ex.
the best and easiest way is to fly or drive to Las Vegas and get married.
of course, let me get to know you more.
I prefr a size C or D. anythign bigger is a waste.
fool and mislead and then make some more.
they haven't done before and the pleasure is twice as nice!
my wife doesn't like to wear those brands.
we don't know what you look like.
because opposites attract and we always find a partner for life.
I think this is better than my personal life.
don't go anywhere with you new date that you went with your ex.
talk with your best friend and see if it is ok.
it sounds weird, but it worked for me in about 3 to 5 days.
I don't like it when he teases you about the little things.
no because i am not yet married.
a big number of guys like heavyset women, they are just black.
I love expressing my feelings to women with poems, has anyone written one for their significant other?
I told her and she expressed her concern about damaging our relationship as friends.
if you like him then you shouldn't care, stay with him.
do they make fun of you when you are with him?
I love those people since im a guy and i don't have to invite a date to the affair.
you shouldn't get married if you feel this strongly about it.
it depends on whether or not a person is vain.
you need to move on and enter a relationship with someone who doesn't hate you.
you should be acquainted with her and sooner or later one of you will ask the other out.
I asked him if he was blowing me off.
maybe some vulgar young guys like the younger asian ladies.
make sure it is your decision.
tell him you are looking to keep it casual.
is he not treating you well, you should be happy.
this situation is a hard one with lots of problems.
they have been pretty good years, not always the easiest.
we've seen each other everyday for like 4 to 5 years.
imagine that I'm the guy you want and then date me.
it never harms anyone to flirt a little!
stick with what you feel inside.
I wish you luck to you.
is it bad if I haven't kissed the girl I have been with for 8 months?
it is the girl's decision.
I think they look better than many other nations.
it would be ok the day after.
see if she is avaliable for dinner and a movie.
some men don't think of their partner when they just get to it.
ask the question in english, I can't understand you.
sorry, but I never felt that way.
remember no bird has ever tried to fly with one wing.
I always think about this issue.
you will never find a man, if you look like DESPONDENT.
I met a girl recently and I want to know if she likes me.
don't just sit around and wait for the phone to ring.
be quiet and be whatever sexual orientation that you want.
many 22-year-old women are in relationships with 21-year-old men feel insecure and search for younger women.
if he comes to his senses, great, if not, you should move on.
he may love you but he may want to disappoint his father.
just humiliate yourself if you apologize to him without committing a mistake, don't get weak!
take action before it's too late.
this woman doesn't want a guy who deceives her.
I'd like to hear the viewpoint of a black woman about this subject.
please help me win this debate against her!
almost without exception (not constantly) those are guys like yourself, more or less.
when will pepole start to realize this?
I don't know what I should do.
you go to a bar and drink until you are drunk.
I behaved like this company of my present romantic partner.
if you have to ask, then that's a negative.
don't sit there and wait until he realizes that you are a good one.
even though I'm getting divorced, I'm still stuck with this.
you will be fine, enjoy yourself.
your girlfriend will only think you are being a jerk.
you can't fix the relationship with her parents, but you can fix the relationship with her friends why do you ask?
personally, I wouldn't get married any female unwilling to relinquish her last name, but that's just my feeling.
maybe you should try to go for young women because they are offensive.
I went out with my ex for 3 years and then he / she cheated.
you will know in time and see what happens for 6 months.
well the one I liked goes something like this.
not all guys break up with their woman.
going there is great fun and there are plenty of things to do.
is it ok to kiss on the first date?
I have a girl friend that I am close with.
they lust for each other.
when he does, you should explain to him that you want to be with him and it was a mistake to break up.
my friend tells me that I'm too nice and I should tell him no.
but there is always an exception, isn't there?
not all men, but some men do.
by doing so, you're still able to retain your surname.
go up to her say hi and ask if she is single.
that really turned on me sexually, but I ran away.
girls who are heavier can still be hot.
not every participant there is going to educational courses.
practice unwrapping Starburst and tying cherry stvid with your tongue.
if you keep on talking to him for another week then he is going to think he is married to you.
I'll pay if I can get your vote for best answer.
look for somewhere in public, where you'll feel most comfortable.
flirt with him and gauge his reaction.
and it calms the pressure I'm feeling to invite somebody.
say you will go out with me.
she doesn't forget my mistakes.
how should i approach her without her thinking im just another guy with bad intentions?
as a man, I might have some insight.
don't worry, you're only 13.
always go trail riding with company.
if the two of you really love each other then you will work things out.
eye contact is the key point.
I can lift him a lot.
he just has to start over and regain your trust again.
I was with my ex boyfriend in the second grade and then in the 4th grade and then again in 8th grade.
why do you want to ask her out?
well, I'm hoping you'll review this info very much.
